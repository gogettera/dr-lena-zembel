          "q": "What if my child doesn't cooperate?",

        {
          "q": "Can we come just for a consultation?",
          "a": "Absolutely. There's no obligation to continue treatment. An initial consultation allows you and your child to meet us and feel comfortable before proceeding with treatment."

        {
          "q": "How do I prepare my child for the first visit?",
          "a": "Talk about the visit in a positive, light way, emphasizing that it's about meeting the doctor and counting teeth. Avoid scary terms or stories about negative experiences."

        {
          "q": "Can parents be present during treatment?",
          "a": "Of course! We encourage parental presence, especially with younger children. However, some older children cooperate better when they come in alone."
