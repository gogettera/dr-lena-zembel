    "faq1Question": "How long do various aesthetic treatments take?",
    "faq1Answer": "Treatment duration varies depending on the type of treatment. In-office teeth whitening can take 1-2 hours. Porcelain veneers usually require 2-3 appointments over a period of 2 weeks. Dental implants are a longer process that may take several months. At the initial consultation, we can provide a more accurate time estimate for your specific treatment.",
    "faq2Question": "Are aesthetic treatments painful?",
    "faq2Answer": "Most aesthetic treatments are performed under local anesthesia and do not involve significant pain. We prioritize patient comfort and offer various options such as laughing gas or sedation for anxious patients. After treatment, you may experience mild sensitivity that typically resolves within a few days.",
    "faq3Question": "How long do the results of aesthetic treatments last?",
    "faq3Answer": "The longevity of results varies depending on the type of treatment. Teeth whitening can last 1-3 years, depending on eating and drinking habits. Porcelain veneers and crowns can last 10-15 years or longer with proper care. Dental implants are designed to be a permanent solution and can last a lifetime with proper maintenance. At the consultation, we'll provide detailed information on the expected lifespan of your specific treatment.",
    "faq4Question": "Are aesthetic treatments suitable for everyone?",
    "faq4Answer": "Most people are good candidates for aesthetic treatments, but suitability depends on overall oral health and specific tooth conditions. Before any aesthetic treatment, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation to ensure the requested treatment is the best option for you. In some cases, preliminary treatments such as gum treatment or root canal may be necessary before performing the aesthetic treatment.",
    "faq5Question": "How do I maintain the results of aesthetic treatment over time?",
    "faq5Answer": "To maintain results over time, it's important to follow a rigorous oral hygiene routine including brushing twice daily, daily flossing, and mouthwash. It's advisable to avoid foods and beverages that can stain (like coffee, tea, red wine), especially after whitening treatments. Additionally, regular check-ups and cleanings with a hygienist every six months are essential for maintaining oral health and treatment results.",
    "faq6Question": "What is the cost of aesthetic treatments?",
    "faq6Answer": "The cost of aesthetic treatments varies depending on the type of treatment, its complexity, and scope. Teeth whitening is typically the least expensive treatment, while implants and full mouth rehabilitation are more expensive. At the initial consultation, after evaluation, we can provide an accurate quote. We also offer flexible payment options and financing plans to accommodate our patients.",
