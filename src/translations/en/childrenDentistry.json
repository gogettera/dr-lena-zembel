    "q1": "When should my child first visit the dentist?",
    "a1": "We recommend the first dental visit around your child's first birthday or within six months after the first tooth appears.",
    "q2": "How often should children have dental check-ups?",
    "a2": "Most children should visit the dentist every six months. Some may need more frequent visits based on their individual oral health needs.",
    "q3": "What if my child is afraid of the dentist?",
    "a3": "Our practice specializes in helping anxious children. We use gentle introduction techniques, child-friendly explanations, and positive reinforcement. For more anxious children, we offer options like nitrous oxide (laughing gas) when appropriate.",
    "q4": "Are baby teeth really important since they fall out anyway?",
    "a4": "Yes! Baby teeth hold space for permanent teeth, assist in proper speech development, and allow for proper nutrition. Early loss can lead to spacing issues and potentially more extensive orthodontic treatment later."
