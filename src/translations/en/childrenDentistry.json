    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "items": [
      {
        "question": "At what age should dental treatments begin?",
        "answer": "Usually recommended around two and a half years old - or after the eruption of the first teeth. An early visit helps accustom the child to the clinic environment and build a positive experience from the start."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if the child doesn't cooperate?",
        "answer": "That's perfectly fine - we have gentle methods based on a psychological approach for children. We adapt the treatment to the child's pace, and sometimes start with just a brief introduction and play during the first visit."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can we come just for consultation?",
        "answer": "Certainly. There is no commitment to continue treatment. An initial consultation is a good opportunity to ask questions, meet the team, and see if the clinic suits you and your child."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I prepare my child for the first visit?",
        "answer": "It's recommended to discuss the visit with the child in a positive and light way, emphasizing that it's a visit to meet the dentist and count teeth. Avoid frightening terms or stories of negative experiences."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can parents be present during treatment?",
        "answer": "Of course. We encourage parental presence in the treatment room, especially with young children. However, sometimes older children cooperate better when they enter alone."
